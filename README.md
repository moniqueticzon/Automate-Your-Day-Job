# PyBank

Created a Python script for analyzing the financial records of PyBank with a financial dataset: ![budget_data.csv](https://github.com/moniqueticzon/Automate-Your-Day-Job/blob/main/PyBank/Data/budget_data.csv). This dataset is composed of two columns, Date and Profit/Losses.

* The total number of months included in the dataset.
* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
